# RTFaceDetect
RTFaceDetect is a software that allows you to use the webcam to make facial recognition through the service offered by Microsoft Azure. You need to enter a subscription key, the server of Azure and the mode of view (Essential or Complete). I saw a similar software at Codemotion and I decided to replicate it in an open source versione (and in Python)
## Requirements
* cv2 (pip install opencv-python)
* [Azure account](https://portal.azure.com)
